## [Program 2](program2.l)

Design a LEX Code to identify and print `valid Identifier` of C/C++ in given Input pattern.

## [Program 3](program3.l)

Design a LEX Code to identify and print `integer and float value` in given Input pattern.

## [Program 4](program4.l)

Design a LEX Code for `Tokenizing` the following C - fragment.

Identify and print: 
 - OPERATORS
 - SEPERATORS
 - KEYWORDS
 - IDENTIFIERS
```
int p = 1, d = 0, r = 4;
float m = 0.0, n = 200.0;
while(p <= 3) {
    if(d == 0) {
        m = m + n * r + 4.5, d++;
    }
    else {
        r++, m = m + r + 1000.0;
    }
    p++;
}
```

# With File Handling

Design a LEX Code to `replace white spaces` of `Input.txt` file by `a single blank` character into 
`Output.txt` file. 


## [Program 7](program7)

Design a LEX Code to `remove the comments` from any `C-Program` given at run-time and store 
into `out.c` file


## [Program 8](program8)

Design  a  LEX  Code  to  `extract  all html  tags ` in  the  given  HTML  file  at  run  time  and  store  into
